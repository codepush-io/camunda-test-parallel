## Decision Framework

When you need to make decisions about [topic area], use this framework:

1. **Question 1**: [e.g., Does this belong in the domain layer?]

2. **Question 2**: [e.g., Is this logic pure business logic?]
   - If YES → [Action/Guideline]
   - If NO → [Action/Guideline]

3. **Question 3**: [e.g., Does this have external dependencies?]
   - If YES → [Action/Guideline]
   - If NO → [Action/Guideline]
